# Invert Binary Tree

<https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/>

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

## Solution Explanation

Swap left and right child recursively

## Time Complexity: O(n)

## Space Complexity: O(n)

`Prac 2`

Missed on the logic => first check if left or right child exists => if so swap them
Then recurse for the same logic for left then right child
finally return the root
