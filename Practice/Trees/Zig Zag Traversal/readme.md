# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

[Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## `Prac 1 thought process`

Basic level order traversal but No need to maintain the level variable => can get when to reverse based on the number of elements in the final answer variable.
