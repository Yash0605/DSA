# N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

[N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

## Solution Explanation

Same as level order traversal only difference is there we know we have 2 children here we are not aware of num children so we need to traverse the children list to get the nodes.
