# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

[Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

## `Prac 1 thought process`

Same as level order traversal, the only thing is that we need to reverse the answer in the end.
